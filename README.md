# SatelliteKit
___Satellite Prediction Library___

`SatelliteKit` is a library, written in Swift, implementing the SGP4/SDP4 earth-orbiting satellite
propagation algorithms first published in the
[SpaceTrack Report #3](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/)
and later refined by Vallado et al in
[Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3](https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/).

The code of this library is derived from [Orekit](https://www.orekit.org) which implements
the above published algorithms as a small part of it's extensive capabilities.
Test output from `SatelliteKit` agrees, to meaninglessly high precision, with Orekit
test output and the test output in the above published paper [1].

(August 2006), Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3".


  _Some people will be surprised by some of my source code comment format; it is a style
  I inherited from a systems programming language I used long ago and it is really not
  appropriate for publicly released code in the modern age (especially since Swift has
  markup built in)._

  _Also note that there is extensive use
  of Unicode characters in property names and other places.  This attempts to match, as
  much as is reasonable, the mathematical notation and Greek characters usage in the
  original 1980 Spacetrack Report._


### Change Notes

At the end of the README.
Lastest change: Version/Tag 2.2.0 -- (2025 Aug 13)

### Important Changes • 2025 Aug 13

#### API Modernization: Coordinate Types

- Replaced tuple-based coordinate representations with dedicated structs:
  - `LatLon` (latitude, longitude)
  - `AziEle` (azimuth, elevation)
  - `RADec` (right ascension, declination)
- All new types are `Equatable`, `Hashable`, and `Sendable`
- Added conversion initializers for migration from legacy tuple APIs
- Refactored all relevant functions and tests to use new types

### Important Changes • 2025 Aug 03

Significant contributed changes. Source compatibility maintained.

### Important Changes • 2025 Feb 16

__The temporary changes to accommodate throwing in the `position` and `velocity` functions has 
been reversed which is a source-incompatible change.  Any use of `position_throwz()` can be 
replaced with `position()` though the `throwz` versions remain available.__

### Important Changes • 2024 Sep 12

The core of `SatelliteKit` operates to generate a 6-D vector of the orbiting object's
position (x, y, z) and velocity (ẋ, ẏ, ż) at the given time.  That 6-D vector is the 
`struct PVCoordinates` and it is derived in the (public) `getPVCoordinates` function 
which calls the (private) `computePVCoordinates` function. When a propagation anomaly 
is detected within `computePVCoordinates` an error is thrown and `getPVCoordinates` 
throws it into the public API. 

The programmer can catch errors from `getPVCoordinates` and take appropriate action,
however, the two functions `Satellite.position` and `Satellite.velocity` (which make
direct calls to `getPVCoordinates`) are more commonly used to obtain an object's 
position and velocity and they **do not** process the errors gracefully -- instead
they cause an immediate failure and exit from the running program.

Some of the possible errors are not outlandish (for examples, a satellite in a low 
orbit may decay, elements may be loaded that contain errors, or elements way past 
their sell-by date may be unpropagatable).

Obviously, this is a **bad** experience for the user and needs to be corrected.  Since
merely making `Satellite.position` and `Satellite.velocity` throw errors would break 
existing code, new versions (same basic purpose, but with different names) have been added 
to catch and re-throw the propagation errors, giving the programmer the ability to dodge a
failure and/or display an error alert to the user.  The non-throwing versions have also
been marked as deprecated so the compiler can issue an advisory message.

In the Sample Usage below, the line 

```swift
    let posInKms = sat.position(minsAfterEpoch: 10.0)
```
should be recoded as

```swift
    do {
        let posInKms = try sat.position_throwz(minsAfterEpoch: 10.0)
    } catch {
    	// code to process the error ..
    }
```

(This workaround will be temporary -- the next MAJOR release of `SatelliteKit` will remove
the non-throwing functions.) 

### Elements

The `Elements` structure is initialized from the three lines of elements in a traditional TLE set.
Some sources of TLEs provide no first line (which would contain the object's informal name) and,
in that case, it is OK to pass a null `String` into the initializer.

```swift
public init(_ line0: String, _ line1: String, _ line2: String) throws
```

The public properties that are exposed from in the `Elements` structure are:

```swift
public let commonName: String                   // line zero name (if any) [eg: ISS (ZARYA)]
public let noradIndex: UInt                     // The satellite number [eg: 25544]
public let launchName: String                   // International designation [eg: 1998-067A]

public let t₀: Double                           // the TLE t=0 epoch time (days since 1950)
public let e₀: Double                           // TLE .. eccentricity
public let i₀: Double                           // TLE .. inclination (radians).
public let ω₀: Double                           // Argument of perigee (radians).
public let Ω₀: Double                           // Right Ascension of Ascending node (radians).
public let M₀: Double                           // Mean anomaly (radians).
public var n₀: Double = 0.0                     // Mean motion (radians/min)  << [un'Kozai'd]
public var a₀: Double = 0.0                     // semi-major axis (Eᵣ)       << [un'Kozai'd]

public let ephemType: Int                       // Type of ephemeris.
public let tleClass: String                     // Classification (U for unclassified).
public let tleNumber: Int                       // Element number.
public let revNumber: Int                       // Revolution number at epoch.
```

Note that the operation to "un Kozai" the element data is performed inside the initialization because
both SGP4 and SDP4 need that adjustment.

The initializer will throw an exception if the numeric parsing of the element data fails, however,
it will not do so if the record checksum fails.  More complete correctness of the element record can
be verified by:

```swift
public func formatOK(_ line1: String, _ line2: String) -> Bool
```

which will return `true` if the lines are 69 characters long, format is valid, and checksums are good.
Note that `line0` doesn't take part in the check so is omitted for this function, and that `formatOK` will
emit explicit errors into the log.

#### Other data formats

There has been concern for some time that the three line element sets will become limited,
not least of all because they only allow 5 digits for a object's unique NORAD numeric identifier.
It has been proposed to provide other, less constricted, data formats.
More information on this move will be found at
[A New Way to Obtain GP Data (aka TLEs)](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/gp-data-formats.php)

`SatelliteKit` has been changed to allow the ingestion of GP data in a JSON form .. for example, given JSON
data, this would decode an array of `Elements` structures (I'm not catching errors in the example, but you should):

```swift
let jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()
jsonDecoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .formatted(DateFormatter.iso8601Micros)

let tleArray = try jsonDecoder.decode([Elements].self, from: jsonData)
print(Satellite(withTLE: tleArray[0]).debugDescription())
print(Satellite(withTLE: tleArray[1]).debugDescription())
print(Satellite(withTLE: tleArray[2]).debugDescription())
```

The `Elements` structure also implements `debugDescription` which will generate this formatted `String`

### Satellite

Having obtained the `Elements` for a satellite (a `struct` which holds only a description of the orbital
elements), it is used to initialize a `Satellite` struct to manage the propagation of the object's 
position and velocity as time is varied from the epochal t₀=0 of the element set.  
Whether the object requires the "deep space" propagator, or not, is determined within the `Satellite` initialization.

The `Satellite` initializers are:

```swift
public init(_: String, _: String, _: String)  	// three TLE lines ..
public init(elements: Elements)             	// an Elements struct ..
```

The `Satellite` struct offers some public properties and some public functions.

The *properties* provide some naming information and a "grab bag" directory for whatever you want.

```swift
public let tle: Elements                    	// make TLE accessible
public let commonName: String                   // "COSMOS .."
public let noradIdent: String                   // "21332"
public let t₀Days1950: Double                   // days since 1950

public var e: Double { return propagator.e }    //### these vary slowly over time ..
public var i: Double { return propagator.i }    //###
public var ω: Double { return propagator.ω }    //###
public var Ω: Double { return propagator.Ω }    //###

public var extraInfo = [String: AnyObject]()    // the "grab bag" dictionary ..
```

The *functions* accept a time argument, either minutes after the satellite's TLE epoch, or Julian Days,
and provide celestial postion (Kilometers) and velocity (Kms/sec) state vectors as output.

```swift
public func position(minsAfterEpoch: Double) -> Vector
public func velocity(minsAfterEpoch: Double) -> Vector

public func position(julianDays: Double) -> Vector
public func velocity(julianDays: Double) -> Vector
```

### Sample Usage

This is a simple invocation of the above:

```swift
do {
    let elements = try Elements("ISS (ZARYA)",
                                "1 25544U 98067A   18039.95265046  .00001678  00000-0  32659-4 0  9999",
                                "2 25544  51.6426 297.9871 0003401  86.7895 100.1959 15.54072469 98577")

    let sat = Satellite(elements)
    print(sat.debugDescription())
    let posInKms = sat.position(minsAfterEpoch: 10.0)

} catch {
    print(error)
}
```

### Dealing with TLE files

The most commonly publically available form of TLE data is a file containing multiple concatenated TLEs.  
The `String` content of such a file may be processed (records that are empty or start with "#" are dropped then
leading and trailing whitespace is stripped and non-breaking spaces are converted to regular spaces)
and checked for quality (line length is 69 characters and the checksum is good) within SatelliteKit with the function:

```swift
public func preProcessTLEs(_: String) -> [(String, String, String)]
```

`preProcessTLEs` consumes a `String` of TLE records and returns an array of
`(String, String, String)` tuples, one per satellite.  The tuple items are the, mildly verified, zeroth, first
and second of one satellite's TLE lines. If the TLEs are the two-line variety, the first member of the
tuple is an empty `String`.

Thus, the contents of a TLE file would be mapped to an array of `Satellite` by:

```swift
let satArray = preProcessTLEs(fileContents).map( { return Satellite($0.0, $0.1, $0.2) } )
```

A more rigorous quality check can be preformed using:

```swift
public func formatOK(_: String, _: String) -> Bool
```

which checks the format of TLE lines "1" and "2" .. using a regex test, a time consuming action
that is not performed in `preProcessTLEs`.

### Inclusion

`SatelliteKit` can be added to your project using the Swift Package Manager (SPM) by adding
the dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/gavineadie/SatelliteKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

and using `import SatelliteKit` in code that needs it.

### Platforms

`SatelliteKit` has been used for applications on iOS devices (iPhone, iPad and TV),
and Macintosh computers (SwiftUI, AppKit and command line).  It has been exposed to the 
Windows and Unix Swift enviroment briefly, but not tested rigorously.

- `TLE` struct replaced with `Elements`
- `TLE` typealias'd to `Elements` (for backward compatibility)
- (for example) `debugDescription()` is now a method on `Elements`
- `TLEPropagator` class replaced with `Propagator` .. (private anyway)

`version/tag 1.1.5 .. (2023 Aug 26)`

- tag `1.0.17` changed to WGS-84 constants which caused a divergence between
  the Vallado results and the results of this library.  That change is reversed,
  as it should be, because Vallado's algorithms are built expecting WGS-72 constants.
  Now the results from this library and Vallado's agree, again, to a ridiculous extent !
- minor edits to README (no functional changes)
- accommodate Xcode 15

`version/tag 1.1.6 .. (2023 Sep 27)`

- add more, and more recent, platforms to the manifest

`version/tag 1.1.7 .. (2023 Nov 06)`

- `MathUtility` .. improve vector dot and cross products (and unit tests) ..
- `ThreeLineElementTests` .. adjust unit tests results for reversion to WGS-72 ..

`version/tag 1.2.3 .. (2024 Sep 11)`

- throwing versions of Satellite position/velocity functions added -- for example `position_throwz(minsAfterEpoch..)`
- Package support for .macOS(.v11), .iOS(.v12), .tvOS(.v12), .watchOS(.v4), .visionOS(.v1)
- macOS 13 and iOS 15/16 required for non-default uses ..

`version/tag 1.2.4 .. (2024 Sep 12)`

- converting the non-throwing versions of Satellite position/velocity functions to throwing functions
  would break source compatibility if the same function names were maintained, hence the use of `_throwz`
  versions.  The next MAJOR release of `SatelliteKit` will make those breaking changes.
  
  `@available(*, deprecated ..)` tags have been added to the non-throwing versions.  They are not
  actually deprecated but this allows the compiler to issue a message informing of the throwing versions.
  
  Since the non-throwing versions are used internally by `SatelliteKit`, there have been `private`
  duplicates of those added for internal libaray use only.

`version/Tag 2.0.0 -- (2025 Feb 16)`

- SatelliteKit version 2 is, nominally, a major upgrade though, in fact, not much has changed, and
  nothing computationally.  It is
  compatible with Swift 6 and required couple of minor source code changes in its clients.
  
  * The use of the `..._throwz()` functions can be replaced with non-throwz versions.
  
  * The function:
  
    `topPosition(minsAfterEpoch: Double, obsLatLonAlt: LatLonAlt)`
  
    is now:
  
    `topPosition(minsAfterEpoch: Double, observer: LatLonAlt)`

`version/Tag 2.1.0 -- (2025 Aug 03) --  contributed by Mathis Gaignet`

Swift 6 Sendable compatibility and Swift Testing migration
- Migrated from class-based inheritance to protocol-based architecture
- Added Sendable conformance to all public types

- Implemented SGP4Propagator, SDP4Propagator, DeepSDP4Propagator structs
- Updated Satellite to use any Propagable instead of Propagator class
- Migrated test suite from XCTest to Swift Testing framework

`version/Tag 3.0.0 -- (2025 Aug 13) -- contributed by Sihao Lu`

- Major API modernization: coordinate types (`LatLon`, `AziEle`, `RADec`)
- All coordinate types are `Equatable`, `Hashable`, and `Sendable`
- Conversion initializers for migration from legacy tuple APIs
- Refactored all relevant functions and tests to use new types
